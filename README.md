# Use other features of an Adafruit Circuit Playground as an input device in a Processing program
In this Arduino lab you will write a program that uses other features of the Adafruit Circuit Playground as an controller for a Processing program. The circuit playground has 16 inputs. Adafruit has a detailed description [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/guided-tour). In addition to the light sensor that we used in the previous assignment, the circuit playground also has a:
* Temperature Sensor
* Microphone Audio Sensor
* Motion Sensor
* A 3-axis accelerometer
* Capacitive Touch sensor
* Two large buttons
* Small center button
* Slide switch 

Here's a sample program that will print the values of 16 inputs. Run the program and then press, touch and manipulate the various sensors to see how they work.
```java {.line-numbers}
import processing.serial.*;
import cc.arduino.*;
Arduino arduino;

public void setup() {
  size(100, 100);
  arduino = new Arduino(this, Arduino.list()[0], 57600);
}

public void draw() {
  background(192);
  for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
    System.out.print(i+" "+arduino.analogRead(i) + "\t");
  System.out.println();
}
```
